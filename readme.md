# Info

This is my way trough video tutrorial [React & Redux With ExpressJS (2016)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLei96ZX_m9sUDK-1b8fNXZgBnnb6wA7sB) on youtube ![YouTube logo](https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/social-icons-5/128/YouTube.png).

In addition to React, Redux and Express, there are used Pug for view layout. 

After 10th lesson counter doesn't show. I suppose it because of difference between react-router-3 and 4. And I didn't find the answer, and didn't try hard.

```
npm install 
npm run webpack
npm app.js
```
